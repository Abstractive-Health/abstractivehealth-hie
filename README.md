# abstractivehealth-hie

We want to share the skeleton of a Python implementation of Carequality. Working through documentation can be difficult, and we want to create a community where implementation knowledge and industry wisdom are freely exchanged.

We use Python 3.8 on AWS Lambda for these functionalities.
